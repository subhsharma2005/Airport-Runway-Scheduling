# Airport-Runway-Scheduling
This project develops a Graphical Airport Runway Scheduler that optimizes the scheduling of multiple flights over available runways. The system collects flight details, calculates optimal scheduling with minimal delay using a priority queue algorithm, and stores historical data in a database. It further enhances usability
with interactive charts visualizing delays over time.
â€¢ The goal is to help airport operators efficiently manage runway assignments and minimize delays for smoother airport operations.
